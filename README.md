# newsy
A News API (https://newsapi.org) Powered React Native News App for learning about redux and nativebase! Pretty much un-styled, but shows patterns such as a splash page, drawer and stack navs, etc.

See https://expo.io/@hornetshell/newsy for the Expo-powered Demo!

## Disclaimer
This is an extremely basic demo of using axios, redux, native-base, and react-native to put together a cross platform news app. This took me roughly 6 hours including the time to download packages, read up on the axios middleware, and do the expo publish on a netbook.

## News API
Great stuff, get a api key for yourself and plug it into the app.json!
